<h1><b>Integrations designed for practical use</b></h1>
<p>
Redon Tech's Integration created to work alongside payhip is an older concept but re-imaginged to function better than existing competitors & all with the benifits of being open source.
</p>
<p>
Our Integration requires only a small bit of setup, some of which is fairly simple to do, and the rest will contain a detailed setup guide on how to get started!

# Advantages of our Integrations Bot

## :fontawesome-solid-1: **Highly Customisable**
Our Integration soultion is easily one of the most customisable options currently out there when it comes to being able to integrate payhip sales into discord.
This is because this bot was built with customisation in mind, and as part of that, various things can be customised within the config.json file or using the config command.<br>
*Some of our customisation includes the ability to change embed colours, Bot status, what events you want sent through, and more!*
---

## :fontawesome-solid-2: **Faster than other avaliable options**

Unlike some of the other options out there that can take 10-15 minutes to push through the sales, our solution normally pushes though sales within 90 seconds of the purchase happening. This helps us deliver a more on point service.<br>
*DISCLAIMER: API Latency, Bot Ping & Payhip can cause these times to vary*
---

## :fontawesome-solid-3: **Less downtime, Full Support**
With the way this bot is coded, it's setup to run into as few errors/crashes as possible to help prevent any downtime that may otherwise occur.
And if you do run into any downtime/issues while using Integrations, we have a small team of support staff who can assist you with most issues that may occur.<br>
*DISCLAIMER: Any self-made customisation to the code may increase downtime of the service or void support.*
