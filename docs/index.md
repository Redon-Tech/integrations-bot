<h1><b>Integrations designed for practical use</b></h1>
<p>
Redon Tech's Integration created to work alongside payhip is an older concept but re-imaginged to function better than existing competitors & all with the benifits of being open source.
</p>
<p>
Our Integration requires only a small bit of setup, some of which is fairly simple to do, and the rest will contain a detailed setup guide on how to get started!
